# Nederburg theme for hugo

Nederburg is a fast and secure theme.

This Hugo theme was ported from [competethemes](https://www.competethemes.com/tracks/).

## Installation

Go to the directory where you have your Hugo site and run:

```
$ mkdir themes
$ cd themes
$ git clone https://github.com/appernetic/hugo-nederburg-theme.git
```

For more information read the official [setup guide](https://gohugo.io/overview/installing/) of Hugo or use [Appernetic](https://appernetic.io/).

## Configuration

After installing the Nederburg theme successfully, we recommend you to take a look at the [exampleSite](https://github.com/appernetic/hugo-nederburg-theme/tree/master/exampleSite) directory. You will find a working Hugo site configured with the Nederburg theme that you can use as a starting point for your site.

First, let's take a look at the [config.toml](https://github.com/appernetic/hugo-nederburg-theme/tree/master/exampleSite/config.toml). It will be useful to learn how to customize your site. Feel free to play around with the settings.

### Gravatar

To have an image in your author bio shown after posts, go to [Gravatar](https://gravatar.com/) and configure it and then add the email address that you have associated with it in the email section in settings:

```toml
email = "your@gravatar.email"
```

### Style

Nederburg uses the minified production version of the style sheet from the wordpress version.

### More style customizations?

Create `css/custom.css` in your `<<base dir>>/static` folder and add all your custom styling.

### Comments

The optional comments system is powered by [Disqus](https://disqus.com). If you want to enable comments, create an account in Disqus and write down your shortname in the config file.

```toml
disqusShortname = "your-disqus-short-name"
```

You can disable the comments system by leaving the `disqusShortname` empty.

### Google Analytics

You can optionally enable Google Analytics. Type your tracking code in the ``.

```toml
googleAnalytics = "UA-XXXXX-X"
```

Leave the `googleAnalytics` key empty to disable it.

### Make the contact form working

Since this page will be static, you can use [formspree.io](//formspree.io/) as proxy to send the actual email. Each month, visitors can send you up to one thousand emails without incurring extra charges. Begin the setup by following the steps below:

1. Enter your email address under 'email' in the [`config.toml`](https://github.com/appernetic/hugo-nederburg-them/tree/master/exampleSite/config.toml)
2. Upload the generated site to your server
3. Send a dummy email yourself to confirm your account
4. Click the confirm link in the email from [formspree.io](//formspree.io/)
5. You're done. Happy mailing!

## Multiple Writers Features
Thanks to Lukas Herman's PR there is now a multiple writers feature. In order to support multiple writers, an extra key, "writers" is added, in config.toml. The format looks like the following:

```toml
  [params.writers."Göran Svensson"]
    link = "https://appernetic.io/"
    email = "goran@molnsys.com"
    bio = [
      "Göran is an avid blogger and the founder of <a href='https://appernetic.io/'>Appernetic.io</a>. This is the author bio shown after posts."
    ]
    facebook      = "full Göran profile url in facebook"
    googleplus    = "full profile url in googleplus"
    twitter       = "full profile url in twitter"
    linkedin      = "full profile url in linkedin"
    stackoverflow = "full profile url in stackoverflow"
    instagram     = "full profile url in instagram"
    github        = "full profile url in github"
    pinterest     = "full profile url in pinterest"
```

Now you must have an author in the config for the author bio section to be visible. If you have a writer and set it in the markdown file it will override the author in the config. See the exampleSite folder for a working solution.


## Images

Default is to use the static folder for images. If you want to have images in the post folder you unmark the seetings in the config file. 

```toml
#UsePostImgFolder = true
```
### Privacy settings for Google Analytics

Thanks to [mstroh76](https://github.com/mstroh76) we now have privacy settings for analytics. This is how you configure it (included in exampleSite config.toml):

```toml
[privacy]
  # Google Analytics privacy settings - https://gohugo.io/about/hugo-and-gdpr/index.html#googleanalytics
  [privacy.googleAnalytics]
    # set to true to disable service 
    disable = false
    # set to true to meet General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
    anonymizeIP = false
    respectDoNotTrack = false
    useSessionStorage = false
```

### Nearly finished

In order to see your site in action, run Hugo's built-in local server.

```
$ hugo server
```

Now enter [`localhost:1313`](http://localhost:1313) in the address bar of your browser.
